# EduMatch
## Program statement: Student skill exchange app
Objective: The Student Skill Exchange App is a platform designed to connect students who want to share and learn new skills from each other. By leveraging a matchmaking system similar to dating apps, the platform fosters peer-to-peer learning opportunities within academic communities.
## Key Features
- User Profile Creation: Students input their basic information, including email, name, major, school, and skill preferences.
- Skill Matching Algorithm: The system pairs students based on the skills they can teach and the skills they want to learn.
- Location-Based Matching: Students can set a radius on a map to connect with nearby students from their school or other institutions within a selected distance.
- Secure Communication: Matched students can connect through a built-in messaging system to arrange learning sessions.
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive UI allows students to navigate matches and manage their learning progress.
- Community Growth: Encourages knowledge-sharing and networking within student communities.
## User Flow
1. Homepage (welcome screen)
2. Sign up/Log in
3. Profile creation
4. Matching process
5. Explore matches
6. Initiate communication
7. Learning (in-person lessons/online meeting)
